# P1---Breast-Cancer-Prediction
 Breast cancer prediction using Feedforward Neural Network

The data is retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

In this project, I've been using sequential model from tensorflow to create a feedforward neural network model.
The model is trained based on 30 features in the dataset which are:-

This is a classification problem where the labels are either "Maglinant" or "Benign".
The model is trained for batch_size of 100 and epochs of 100.
The model achieved 95.61% Training Accuracy and 24% Loss Accuracy.
